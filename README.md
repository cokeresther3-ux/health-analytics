# Breast cancer prediction

This study employed a quantitative computational design to evaluate the performance of a decision tree in predicting breast cancer and analysing the key features involved in determining breast cancer. A machine learning approach was chosen because it has the potential to improve accuracy and capture complex relationships between the features. The analysis was conducted using the cancer prediction dataset obtained from Kaggle. The dataset included 1500 participants (aged 20-80 years) with demographic variables (age, gender, BMI), medical history(cancer history, diagnosis, genetic risk) and lifestyle factors (smoking, physical activity, alcohol intake).
Data analysis was conducted using python (version 3.11) with the libraries pandas, scikit learn, numpy and matplotlib. Pre-processing included inspecting the dataset for duplicates and missing values. The data was further split into 80% training and 20% testing. A decision tree model was built using the DecisionTreeClassifier function from scikit-learn. The tree used Gini impurity to evaluate the splits. A decision tree model was further selected because of its ability to handle both categorical and numerical values, and to capture non-linear relationships.
The models performance was assessed using accuracy, precision, F1 score, confusion matrices as well as ROC-AUC.
